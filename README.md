# Master's thesis project: a tool for microRNA target prediction with applications to cancer research

This is some of the code which I am writing for my master's thesis: a microRNA target prediction model, built upon [TargetScan](http://www.targetscan.org), which takes expression profiles and multiple simultaneous microRNA-mRNA interactions into consideration.
I will use the model for explaining part of the variability between cancer and normal cells gene expression.

The code does not work out-of-the-box because the data is not in the repository.
If you are interested in running the code, or you have questions, do not hesitate to contact me!
