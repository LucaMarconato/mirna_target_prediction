* TODO check that "reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped" is equal to the RPM computed on "reads"
* TODO apply the changes I have been suggested in Python code
* DONE find the distribution of the length of the clusters and prepare the clustering procedure
* DONE fix omp
* TODO small cases (write also a python code for showing what it is happening in this cases)
* TODO introduce the various lambdas for taking into account of the effect of clusterization in the ratio between mirna and target absolute quantities and introduce a second lambda acting as a tuning parameter for modeling the ratio between the mirna absolute quantity and the gene absolute quantity
* TODO validate the animation with the real data
* DONE check the rate of convergence independently of the magnitude of the mirna level
* TODO plot the animation for clusters
* TODO compute the exchange for all the pairs, both the instant one and the cumulative
* TODO compute the weighted context score and compare it the one computed trivially
* TODO stability of the method, for the expression levels, the exchange and the context (do it in the log-scale to have comparable constant variance)
* TODO check different RPM and choose the right treshold based on different samples and of the variance
* TODO find the real GDC data and build the interaction graph on the difference of expressed mRNAs (consider using average levels of tumor and normal, to study the average differences)
* TODO highlight the differences in the response between normal and tumor samples
* TODO implicit first order approximation
* TODO build the multiple linear regression model
NEXT
* TODO copy the gif to not having to generate them again
* TODO test new plot about convergence
* TODO test lambda
* TODO plot the interaction matrix
* TODO textual log of convergence
* TODO try different lambdas and look at the textual log
BONUS
* TODO use the tool to find (with bruteforce and stepwise approach) to find a set of artificial sequences to insert in the cell colture to minimise the differences in down-regulation between normal and tumor cells
