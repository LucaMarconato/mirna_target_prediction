* TODO check that "reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped" is equal to the RPM computed on "reads"
* TODO apply the changes I have been suggested in Python code
* DONE find the distribution of the length of the clusters and prepare the clustering procedure
* DONE fix omp
* DONE small cases
* DONE introduce the various lambdas for taking into account of the effect of clusterization in the ratio between mirna and target absolute quantities (this is not needed!) and introduce a second lambda acting as a tuning parameter for modeling the ratio between the mirna absolute quantity and the gene absolute quantity
* DONE validate the animation with the real data
* DONE check the rate of convergence independently of the magnitude of the mirna level
* DONE plot the animation for clusters
* TODO compute the exchange for all the pairs, both the instant one and the cumulative
* TODO interseting: find the correlation between the density of the entries of the interaction matrix and the quantity of exchanged mirnas and clusters
* TODO compute the weighted context score and compare it the one computed trivially
* TODO stability of the method, for the expression levels, the exchange and the context (do it in the log-scale to have comparable constant variance)
* TODO check different RPM and choose the right treshold based on different samples and of the variance
* TODO find the real GDC data and build the interaction graph on the difference of expressed mRNAs (consider using average levels of tumor and normal, to study the average differences)
* TODO highlight the differences in the response between normal and tumor samples
* TODO implicit first order approximation
* TODO build the multiple linear regression model
NEXT
* TODO finish the simualtions which are trivial
* TODO check 118
* TODO check the simulation with conserved only
* TODO in cons and not-cons check if the sipler methods would work, if not how many rows do not make it possible
* TODO check th information on the complementary strands on miRNAs
BONUS
* TODO use the tool to find (with bruteforce and stepwise approach) to find a set of artificial sequences to insert in the cell colture to minimise the differences in down-regulation between normal and tumor cells
