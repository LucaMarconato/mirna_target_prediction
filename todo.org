* TODO check that "reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped" is equal to the RPM computed on "reads"
* TODO find the distribution of the length of the clusters and prepare the clustering procedure
* TODO apply the changes I have been suggested in Python code
* TODO fix omp
* TODO small cases
* TODO validate the animation with the real data
* TODO check the rate of convergence independently of the magnitude of the cluster level
* TODO plot the animation for clusters
* TODO compute the exchange for all the pairs, both the instant one and the cumulative
* TODO compute the weighted context score and compare it the one computed trivially
* TODO stability of the method, for the expression levels, the exchange and the context (do it in the log-scale to have comparable constant variance)
* TODO check different RPM and choose the right treshold based on different samples and of the variance
* TODO find the real GDC data and build the interaction graph on the difference of expressed mRNAs (consider using average levels of tumor and normal, to study the average differences)
* TODO highlight the differences in the response between normal and tumor samples
* TODO implicit first order approximation
* TODO build the multiple linear regression model

BONUS
* TODO use the tool to find (with bruteforce and stepwise approach) to find a set of artificial sequences to insert in the cell colture to minimise the differences in down-regulation between normal and tumor cells
